# Concert Crowd Simulation

Agent-based / cellular automaton simulation of crowd dynamics in a concert pit.

The model explores how local interactions, attraction to the stage, song energy, and individual behavior produce emergent patterns such as high-density regions and mosh-pit-like motion, while tracking exhaustion as a safety-related metric.
